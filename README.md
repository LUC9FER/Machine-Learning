# Machine-Learning
This repository contains the skin cancer detection model which was created with the helpp of python
# Points To Follow:

. You will need `Jupyter Notebook` or 'Google Collab' to run the analysis code and the project report. 

. Once that's done, you can execute any code you'd like. 

. Data Pre-Processing Code and Machine Learning Models Code can be found in the `src` folder

. You will also need to download the dataset from the link mentioned below and put it in the `data` folder.

  There are 7 datasets file: `HAM10000_images_part_1, HAM10000_images_part_2, HAM10000_metadata.csv, hmnist_28_28_L.csv, hmnist_28_28_RGB.csv, hmnist_8_8_L.csv, hmnist_8_8_RGB.csv` in which the file tat needs to be downloaded is `hmnist_8_8_RGB.csv`
 
. Project report are in stored in the `pdf` format can be found in the `reports` folder whereas project report in `ipynb` format is in the `src` folder. 
  
. Structured Abstarct is also stored in the `pdf`  format in the `reports` folder whereas its `ipynb` format can be found in the `src`.
