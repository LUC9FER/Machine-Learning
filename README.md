# Machine-Learning
This repository contains the skin cancer detection model which was created with the help of python <br>

## Points To Follow:

* You will need `Jupyter Notebook` or 'Google Collab' to run the analysis code and the project report. <br>

* Once that's done, you can execute any code you'd like. <br>

* You will also need to download the dataset from the link mentioned below and put it in the `data` folder. 
  `https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000`. There are 7 datasets file: `HAM10000_images_part_1, HAM10000_images_part_2, HAM10000_metadata.csv, hmnist_28_28_L.csv, hmnist_28_28_RGB.csv, hmnist_8_8_L.csv, hmnist_8_8_RGB.csv` in which the file that needs to be downloaded is `hmnist_8_8_RGB.csv` <br>
