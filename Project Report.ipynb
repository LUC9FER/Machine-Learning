    "In this report, we are going to see how we can harness the power of machine learning by building classification models and using them to predict whether a patient is suffering from skin cancer or not and classify the type of cancer they are suffering from. We will also see the work that went into tuning the pre-trained models and the change in their performance which will be measured in terms of accuracy percentage every time the model is tunned. The report will also emphasize the future work that needed to be done on these models or an alternate way of prediction and classification. "

    "The focus of this project is on building a machine learning model for skin cancer where the model can take data of features that can help to classify the types of skin cancer as input and based on that features data that model can tell us about the type of skin cancer a particular person has.

    "Before discussing the need for this project let's see what skin cancer actually is and what dangers does it poses. Skin cancer is said to be the out-of-control development of abnormal cells in the epidermis which is the outermost skin layer. (Sarnoff D., 2022). It is considered that detecting skin cancer at an early stage can prevent the risk of disfigurement that can occur through removal and also most serious cases that can lead to a patient’s death. (skcin.org). The most common technique of detecting skin cancer is a device created by DermaSensor a health technology company which is a fast point and click device that asses the lesions in the patients. The device weighs around 1.9KG has a standard 110v-250v/50-60Hz general power outlet. It also has a handheld unit that uses AI & spectroscopy for assessing. It has a success rate of 93% when it comes to detecting skin cancer (medicaldevice-network.com, 2021). The goal of this project is to increase this success percentage of detecting cancer and also instead of having some prerequisites for using such technology, we can use a simple software to detect skin cancer and can see its type.

    "For dealing with the imbalanced classification I used the **resampling technique**. This technique contains two methods:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Undersampling the majority class in which we remove a few observations that belong to the majority holder class. This technique is only efficient when we have data in million because removing the original observation which is valuable and can lead to model underfitting. Underfitting is a situation in the field of data science where a machine learning model is not able to grasp the relationship between features and dependent variables accurately. (ibm.com, 2021). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tOversampling the minority class where we add data for minority class so that we can bring the count of each class on an equal scale. The adding of the data can be done in two ways. The first way is **Random Over Sampling** in which the technique replicates the minority class observations whereas the second one is **SMOTE** which is also known as **Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique** in which we use the **KNN algorithm** (which will be discussed in the Machine learning model section) to generate synthetic data samples. (Kumar S., 2020). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the SMOTE technique to create synthetic samples for the minority class because the dataset only contains 10016 and using undersampling could have resulted in a huge loss of the data. The reason behind using SMOTE instead of using random oversampling is to maintain the quality of data as random oversampling is just replicating the data samples whereas in the case of SMOTE we are producing synthetic points which can be good for the machine learning model. <br>"

    "To conclude this section, it can be easily interpreted that for this kind of dataset there are very limited pre-trained classification models available and it is possible that higher accuracy can be achieved by finding the best parameter with the best value settings. Although the work is not done there are still various models and hyperparameters are left which can help us with the problem of overfitting and can give us the best accuracy score where the model is taking all the classes into account.

    "Although as of now the accuracies are not that good there is a lot of potential with the machine learning models and certain areas that are worth exploring in the near future. There are two methods that we can work with. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning Models:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "The first approach can be to continue working with the classification models. We can tune the hyper meter with all the possible values or we can use other powerful models such as XG boost. The accuracy can also be increased if instead of creating synthetic data we can collect more real data to balance the dataset. Till now we were mixing the dummy data which can also be one of the reasons for such performance but with the real data, the results can be different. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach can be using CNN model. CNN stands for Convolution Neural Network where we use images as the data and with the help of the neural network, we can do predictions. They are best known for processing data that are based on a grid pattern. In brief, we use four layers or building blocks named **Convolution & Pooling** to perform feature extraction, **Flattening** to create an input matrix for the fourth layer **Fully Connected** where the neural network performs prediction.

    "Working on this project helped me to understand the real power of machine learning and how we can use this power to help others. Although the accuracies were not that good using numerous approaches for preprocessing and tuning the hyperparameters helped me to understand that there are a variety of solutions that can be implemented on a single problem that can give different results I also learned about this amazing library SKLEARN where we can find most of the classification as well regression models. Along with this I also learned about the technique SMOTE where we can create synthetic data. The thing that I found most difficult was to handle the imbalanced dataset as it was a huge risk that I took while creating dummy data. To conclude, I would like to use a deep learning approach to solve similar kinds of problems.   "
